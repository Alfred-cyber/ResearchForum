# ResearchForum
A research forum for Academia


I created this Research Forum to provide a vibrant and collaborative space for researchers, students, and academics. The platform allows users to:

📤 Upload and share research publications

🔍 Discover upcoming conferences and academic opportunities

💬 Engage with other researchers through shared interests and tags

📚 Build a digital portfolio of academic contributions

The goal is to foster meaningful connections, increase visibility of research efforts, and encourage collaboration across disciplines.
